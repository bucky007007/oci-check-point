# Check Point Security Gateway Cluster - BYOL

This quick start deploys two Check Point R80.30 Security Gateways to be configured as a HA cluster.

There are two options for deployment:
- create a new network with a public and private subnet to launch the gateways into
- launch the gateways into an existing network

Once the deployment has finished, follow this [guide](https://supportcenter.checkpoint.com/supportcenter/portal?eventSubmit_doGoviewsolutiondetails=&solutionid=sk142872&partition=General&product=CloudGuard) to finish configuring the cluster.
